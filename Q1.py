#Variables & Data Types

#1) Initialize each data type in python as a unique variable
#Follow the rules for variable names
#Output each created variable using the print() function

#2) Create two string variables s1 & s2
#Create a new variable s3 that adds s1 & s2 together
#print this new variable out

#This is called concatenation,
#in python you are able to add two objects of the same data type together to combine them
