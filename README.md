The Intro to Python workshop will be an introductory workshop to bring all students together on a foundational understanding of the main language utilized to work with AI tools. Python serves as the backbone to build all other knowledge of AI on top of. This workshop will introduce students on necessary topics from variables to classes. The workshop itself will include a presentation on the introduction to Python. There will also be supplemental learning material where students will be given a coding file and will apply the topics shown to them during the workshop. The primary expectation on the outcome of this workshop is that students will take away the start to learning a new skill. Specifically, the expectations are that students will learn and be moderately comfortable with the python language fundamentals to move forward in practicing these concepts during discussions on AI tools. As mentioned before, what we have prepared for the workshop is a presentation on the Python fundamentals as well as supplemental learning material in the form of a Python file where students will have hands-on experience applying the concepts they learn.
